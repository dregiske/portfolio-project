# Andre Giske - Portfolio 2025

This is my portfolio to display myself, my projects, my achievements, and my contact


## Proposed Template + Enhancements
1. Hero Section (Opening Page)
- Big Name Display:
- Centered, large font (think bold sans-serif for modern look).
- Subtle animation (fade-in) for your name or tagline.

2. Short Tagline or Role:
- E.g., "Full-Stack Developer & AI Enthusiast" under your name.

3. Background:
- Could be a minimal gradient, abstract shapes, or a looping muted video related to tech/design.

4. Navigation (Top Center)
- Sticky Nav (stays at top when scrolling).
- Smooth scroll to sections when links are clicked.
- Menu items: About, Projects, Achievements, Contact.

5. About Me Section
- Professional photo or avatar on one side, short bio on the other.
- Include a few key facts or stats (years experience, skills, awards).
- Subtle fade-in animations as user scrolls down.

6. Projects Section
- Grid layout with cards for each project.
- Each card: screenshot, project title, short description, and "View Project" link.
- Option: Hover effects (zoom-in, tilt, shadow glow).

7. Achievements Section
- Timeline or card layout for awards, certificates, notable events.
- Could use icons or badges for visual appeal.

8. Contact Me Section
- Simple contact form (Name, Email, Message).
- Icons linking to GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.
- Option: add a "Download Resume" button with an icon.

9. Footer
- Minimal copyright.
- Quick links or social icons.
- Back-to-top button.

9. Extra Ideas for Modern Flair
- Dark/Light mode toggle for user preference.
- Scroll animations (subtle motion as sections enter view).
- Minimal color palette (2â€“3 main colors for sleekness).
- Favicon + meta tags for sharing previews.
- Performance-optimized for mobile and desktop.
